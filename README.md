# Unobtrusive Search Behaviour Aalysis
Project by IAM x UHH

## How To
1. Please open (preferably) a new Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge window
2. `Load unpacked` extension in the browsers extension settings (if not already done)
3. Go , start the recorder by clicking the play button
4. After the screen-sharing dialog has opened, please click `share` as it is suggested by default
5. Keep the tab open and do not redirect. Simply create a new tabs as "working tabs" for your further interaction
6. Please be aware that the already open tabs, which are not tabs where the extension was started from, will only startu recording once refreshed
7. Search for your literature needs
8. Once finished, either open the extension and click on the `Stop` icon, or simply use the screen capturing overlay and click on `Stop sharing``
9. Click on the appropriate feedback opton poping up in the extension`s UI and your generated files get downloaded automatically (3 files will be created and downloaded)


## Troubleshooting
- The screen capture did not start (no overlay opened for permission to share screen)
Simply reload your current tab and try again
- There is still a screen recording sign in my tab and a UI element after stopping on my screen
That is a weird bug by the screen capturing API of MDN. If you finished the recording and your data has been downloaded already, simply click on `Stop sharing`, close or refresh the window.
- The browser only downloaded one or two files
Sometimes, especially in a fresh setup, the browser asks for your consent to download mutliple files from the webpage. Simply click `Allow` once the prompt pops up on the top-left corner of your browser window
